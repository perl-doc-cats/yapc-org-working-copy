    <h4>Hosting YAPC</h4>
     <div class="contentarea">
     <p>Why would you want to host YAPC?</p>
     <p>First and foremost, it's a great service to the Perl community. Some people write code and contribute to Perl or CPAN, but many of the great things that happen in our community start because of a conversation at a conference. Face-to-face meetings are an essential part to keeping Perl alive and vibrant, and by hosting YAPC you are creating the environment for the energy and exchange of ideas Perl needs.</p>
    <p>Many groups have reported that hosting YAPC revitalized Perl in their local area. It pulls together the local Perl Mongers group, pulls in people who have never before gotten involved, and gives Perl a boost in the local IT scene.</p>
    <p>It's a great way to get involved with The Perl Foundation and the Perl community.</p>
    <p>Hosting a large event like a YAPC is sound experience you can put on your resume and leverage in your career.</p>
