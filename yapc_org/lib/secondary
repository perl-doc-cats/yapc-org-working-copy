	<p>This is what I took from YAPC: a real desire to learn Perl at a deeper level.  I sat in talks going, "I didn't know that!"<br /><br />
What did my employer get out of YAPC? Well, I'm dedicated to becoming a better Perl programmer, which is a plus for them.<br /><br />
I'm looking forward to YAPC::NA 2008.</p>
